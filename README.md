# Fraction
A coding project that does simple arithmetic operations on two fractions 
Program made for my brothers school math project. His math game required a whole number 
and a fraction to be added, multiplied, subtracted, and/or divided. This program computes 
all the different combinations of numbers and creates the answer sheet.

There are also some extra methonds such as an even check, a min/max, getGCD, and findGCD
that gets the GCD between 2 fractions.
